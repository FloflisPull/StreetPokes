## Introduction

**PS**: I'm not the original creator of Street Chaves, Cybergamba. This is a fan repo for an abandonned freeware.

The idea is to enable and inspire the flourishing of forks with "mods"; I'll do a first one to begin that all: for Pokémon, homenaging Pokkén Tournament.

## Development

1. Be sure to be at an Unix (like MacOS) or Linux environment.
2. Fork and/or clone this repo to your machine
3. Install [webpresent](https://github.com/FilePeace/webpresent) and, on the StreetChaves folder, run `init.sh` so Chaves.exe will be downloaded
4. Do the modifications you need (for .wav files, keep them mono instead of stereo and export as 8bit pcm - pcm_u8)
5. run `distribute.sh`
